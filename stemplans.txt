Compare each entry between stem_list and q_list 
Loop through q_list 
If item starts with (a):
Check qstem_list. 
If it has no stem, set corresponding q_list entry to None until (a) is reached again in q_list
If it has a stem, copy that value to all corresponding entries until (a) is reached again in q_list 

Empty list 
Loop through q_list: 
If item starts with (a) and q_list has no stem: 
Put 'None' in stem_list 
Elif item starts with (a) and q_list has stem: 
Put stem in stem_list

Empty list
Loop through q_list 
If item starts with (a):
Check qstem_list:
If it has no stem, add None to empty list until (a) is reached again in q_list
If it has a stem, add that stem to empty list until (a) is reached again in q_list 





Start with this: 
i=0
for sublist in q_list:
for item in sublist:
code here
i+=1



Val=None 
i=0
a and stem:
val=stem
i+=1
stem and not a: 
a and no stem:
val=None 
i+=1
no stem and not a 

list.append(val)


val=None 
i=0
if a and stem[i] has a stem: 
val=stem
i+=1 
elif a and stem[i] has no stem:
val=None 
i+=1 
list.append(val)
